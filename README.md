# 99 Puzzle
This project is a parody of 15 puzzle with more features such as audio, best time with localStorage, and APM tracker.
Better optimized for speedrunning as there are no tile animations, allowing for frame-lossless rotations


## Objective:

## Controls: 
Arrow keys will move adjacent tiles into the empty cell.
