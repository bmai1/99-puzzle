Explores states using a custom PriorityQueue and SolverState class.

Methods of SolverState:
.locate() -> returns index of empty cell (0) within grid, returns [i, j]
.isSolved() -> compares grid curState to answerState, returns bool
.validMoves() -> returns valid moves in curState, returns char arr (udlr)
.applyMove() -> returns copy of grid after swapping empty cell corresponding to move parameter


Two solving algorithsm; both yield the optimal solution (least amount of moves) but are very slow.

a-solve.js is an implementation of A* search with a Manhattan distance heuristic.
It is more optimized than b-solve.js, but caps out at around ~14 moves before
the browsers locks up. 

b-solve.js is a more traditional BFS and caps out at around 6 moves.
